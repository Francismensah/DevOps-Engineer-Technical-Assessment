# Section 1: General Technical Knowledge

## 1. Key Security Concerns in DevOps

- Secrets management (protecting credentials, API keys, and sensitive data)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning
- Container security and image scanning
- Supply chain security (dependency management and vulnerability scanning)
- Access control and least privilege principle
- Secure CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Runtime security monitoring and compliance
- Network security and segmentation

## 2. Designing a Self-Healing Distributed Service

- Implement health checks and readiness probes
- Use circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Implement automatic scaling based on metrics
- Deploy across multiple availability zones
- Use service mesh for resilient communication
- Implement retries and backoff strategies
- Set up automated rollbacks on failure
- Use stateful services for data persistence
- Implement dead letter queues for failed operations

## 3. Centralized Logging Solution for Microservices

### ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack Implementation:

- **Application level:** Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Transport layer:** Use Filebeat/Fluentd to collect logs from containers
- **Processing:** Logstash for parsing and enrichment
- **Storage:** Elasticsearch for searchable log storage
- **Visualization:** Kibana for analysis and dashboards
- **Retention:** Implement log rotation and archival policies
- **Authentication:** Secure access to logging infrastructure
- **Tracing:** Use distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for request tracking

## 4. Reasons for Choosing Terraform

- Infrastructure as Code with declarative syntax
- Provider-agnostic approach
- State management capabilities
- Strong dependency management
- Large community and module ecosystem
- Plan/Apply workflow for change validation
- Integration with multiple cloud providers
- Version control friendly
- Excellent documentation and support

## 5. Secure CI/CD Architecture Using GitOps

For detailed architecture diagrams and implementation details, see ![Secure GitOps CI/CD Architecture](/docs/architecture/Secure-GitOps-CI:CD-Architecture.png)

### Implementation Details:

- Use separate repositories for application code and configuration
- Implement branch protection and required reviews
- Use sealed secrets for sensitive data
- Implement network policies and service mesh
- Use image signing and verification
- Implement RBAC for all components
- Use admission controllers for security policies
- Implement automated security scanning
- Use separate namespaces for isolation

## 6. Debugging Intermittent React Native Build Failures

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. Check build logs for specific error patterns
2. Verify Node.js and dependency versions
3. Clear build caches and node_modules
4. Check for memory/resource constraints
5. Verify native dependencies are properly linked
6. Test builds in clean environment
7. Monitor CI/CD resource utilization
8. Implement detailed build logging
9. Set up build artifacts retention
