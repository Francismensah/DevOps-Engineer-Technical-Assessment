# Section 4: Behavioral

## 13. Describe a time you improved the performance of an infrastructure system. What challenges did you face?
**Example**:
- **Scenario**: Optimized an AWS-hosted microservices application experiencing high latency.
- **Actions**:
  - Migrated from an inefficient EC2-based architecture to containerized services using Kubernetes.
  - Implemented caching layers (Redis) to reduce database load.
  - Configured auto-scaling to handle variable traffic patterns.
- **Challenges**:
  - Balancing system downtime during migration.
  - Ensuring team alignment and knowledge transfer on the new architecture.
- **Outcome**: Reduced latency by 40% and improved scalability.

## 14. How do you prioritize tasks when multiple urgent issues arise?
- **Evaluate Impact and Urgency**:
  - Assess the business and customer impact of each issue.
  - Identify dependencies and risks associated with delays.
- **Communicate Clearly**:
  - Inform stakeholders about priorities and provide realistic timelines.
- **Leverage Tools**:
  - Use task management systems (e.g., Jira, Trello) to track and organize work.
- **Delegate**:
  - Assign tasks to team members based on their expertise to address issues faster.
- **Stay Focused**:
  - Address critical issues sequentially while maintaining clarity on overall goals.
