# Section 3: Monitoring and Troubleshooting

## 11. How would you set up monitoring for the React Native mobile appâ€™s API endpoints?
- **Set Up Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus to monitor API performance.
- **Implement Logging**: Add structured logs using libraries like Winston or Bunyan to capture detailed request and response data.
- **Track Metrics**: Monitor key metrics such as response time, error rates, throughput, and API availability.
- **Alerting System**: Configure alerts for anomalies or threshold breaches using tools like PagerDuty or Slack integrations.
- **Integration with Mobile App**: Use mobile performance monitoring tools (e.g., Firebase Performance Monitoring) to detect API issues from the app's perspective.

## 12. Explain how you would debug high latency in the Node.js microservices.
- **Identify Bottlenecks**:
  - Use APM tools (e.g., New Relic, AppDynamics) to identify slow endpoints or database queries.
  - Analyze logs for patterns of latency.
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Check for slow queries using `EXPLAIN` or performance insights.
  - Optimize indexes or caching strategies.
- **Profile the Service**:
  - Use profiling tools like `clinic.js` or `node-inspect` to detect blocking operations or memory leaks.
- **Check Network Issues**:
  - Ensure low latency between services by analyzing network performance and retries.
- **Optimize Code**:
  - Audit code for inefficient loops, blocking I/O, or unoptimized third-party libraries.
